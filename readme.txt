This plugin adds a beautiful photo stack gallery with jQuery and CSS3 to Lazyest Gallery.

== Description ==

Based on [Beautiful Photo Stack Gallery with jQuery and CSS3](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2010/06/27/beautiful-photo-stack-gallery-with-jquery-and-css3/) 

The plugin shows the albums as a slider, and when an album is chosen, it shows the images of that album as a photo stack. In the photo stack view, you can browse through the images by putting the top most image behind all the stack with a slick animation.

The plugin uses jQuery and CSS3 properties for the rotated image effect. It also uses the webkit-box-reflect property in order to mirror the boxes in the album view â€“ check out the [demo](http://brimosoft.nl/stacked/) in Google Chrome or Apple Safari to see this wonderful effect.
